**📅 Event Page:** [technologytransfer.it/events/generative-ai-creating-a-llm-chatbot-for-business](https://technologytransfer.it/events/generative-ai-creating-a-llm-chatbot-for-business/)

## 📌 Description

Generative AI has significantly advanced in 2024, revolutionizing the development of Chatbots across business applications.

ChatGPT, powered by OpenAI's GPT-4 Large Language Model (LLM), has transformed the AI landscape. These powerful neural networks—trained on massive text datasets—enable human-level understanding and task execution across various domains. Prompted in natural language, ChatGPT offers an interactive experience where users can explore a wide range of functionalities.

The emergence of **Prompt Engineering**—a combination of art and science—has enabled developers to guide LLMs to solve highly specialized tasks. Tools like **LangChain**, document parsing libraries, vector databases, and memory modules form a flexible and powerful tech stack to create intelligent conversational agents.

> ⚠️ Chatbots and LLMs are disruptive technologies. Companies that fail to adopt these tools risk falling behind. This course is designed to empower your team to lead, not lag, in this technological wave.
